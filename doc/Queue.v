Module Type QUEUE.
  (** The first four components are identical to those from [STACK]. *)

  Parameter t : Set -> Set.
  Parameter rep : forall T, t T -> list T -> hprop.

  Parameter new : forall T,
    Cmd __ (fun q : t T => rep q nil).
  Parameter free : forall T (q : t T),
    Cmd (rep q nil) (fun _ : unit => __).

  (** The type of the [enqueue] method is a little more complicated than [push]'s type, since we model enqueueing as addition to the end of a list. *)

  Parameter enqueue : forall T (q : t T) (x : T) (ls : [list T]),
    Cmd (ls ~~ rep q ls) (fun _ : unit => ls ~~ rep q (ls ++ x :: nil)).

  (** The specification for [dequeue] is equivalent to the stack [pop] spec; we write it differently with the structure of our correctness proofs in mind. *)

  Parameter dequeue : forall T (q : t T) (ls : [list T]),
    Cmd (ls ~~ rep q ls) (fun xo => ls ~~ match xo with
                                              | None => [ls = nil] * rep q ls

Module Queue : QUEUE.
  (** The implementation begins the same way as for [Stack], declaring a type parameter and defining a type of singly-linked list nodes. *)

  Section Queue.
    Variable T : Set.

    Record node : Set := Node {
      data : T;
      next : option ptr
    }.
    
    (** To allow us to describe a list with special focus on its last element, we define an alternate list representation, this time parameterized on both head and tail nodes. *)

    Fixpoint listRep (ls : list T) (hd tl : ptr) {struct ls} : hprop :=
      match ls with
        | nil => [hd = tl]
        | h :: t => Exists p :@ ptr, hd --> Node h (Some p) * listRep t p tl
      end.

    (** A queue itself is a pair of pointers to the first and last nodes in the list.  When the queue is empty, each pointer will point to a null pointer. *)

    Record queue : Set := Queue {
      front : ptr;
      back : ptr
    }.

    (** We make a final auxiliary definition before [rep], parameterizing it by the functional list and the values pointed to by the front and back pointers, rather than by the queue and the list. *)

    Definition rep' ls fr ba :=
      match fr, ba with
        | None, None => [ls = nil]
        | Some fr, Some ba => Exists ls' :@ list T, Exists x :@ T,
          [ls = ls' ++ x :: nil] * listRep ls' fr ba * ba --> Node x None
        | _, _ => [False]
      end.

    (** Now it's easy to define [rep].  We quantify existentially over the values pointed to by the queue fields and appeal to [rep']. *)

    Definition rep q ls := Exists fr :@ option ptr, Exists ba :@ option ptr,
      front q --> fr * back q --> ba * rep' ls fr ba.

    (** We define a short simplification tactic that we will plug into [sep] as its second argument.  We constructed this code by iterating interactively with the method definitions that follow.  We won't discuss the details of [simplr] any further, but you can try commenting out parts of it to see what parts of later code fail. *)

    Ltac simplr := repeat (try congruence;

    (** We have an unfolding lemma analogous to the first one that we saw for [Stack]. *)

    Lemma rep_nil : forall q,

    (** Another simple lemma gives a simplification rule for a queue whose back pointer is known to be non-null, corresponding to the second unfolding lemma from [Stack]. *)

    Lemma rep'_Some2 : forall ls o1 ba,

      unfold rep'; sep fail simplr.
    Qed.

    (** One more unfolding lemma is critical to automating our proofs.  We need to simplify cases where the front pointer is non-null.  This is tricky because our definition of [listRep] is oriented towards decomposing the list from the back.  As a prelude to our final lemma, we prove some facts about pure lists.  These facts could profitably be added to a generic list library.  Some of these lemmas may seem confusingly trivial; we prove them so that they may be used as [auto] hints. *)

    (** Finally, we come to the unfolding lemma we need.  Again, it has a completely automated proof.  We will not go into detail on how we arrived at this proof script; design was again driven by iteration with the code to follow.  You can try omitting parts of this script or breaking it into stages to get a better idea of what is going on here. *)
